            <h5>Our school is one of the most advanced schools in all of Colorado and one of best ranking ones too. Our school was graded in the top third of Colorado schools in academic proficiency, with a 95.5% four-year graduation rate and high grades in math and science. We has a wide variety of STEM classes. Our school is very technology- and science-oriented, and STEM activities are not only popular, but encouraged. It is not uncommon to see a knot of kids coding Java out in the hallway before class in the morning, and the technology room is almost always full of people working on their own tech projects. The technology and graphic classes are the most popular electives for all grades, so much so that nearly every period is full.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>Our school offers a wide variety of classes in engineering, science, technology, business and math. Our STEM program is one of the most robust in the state. We have more than fifty math, science, and engineering classes, with eleven of them being APs and a total of fourteen with an option for college credit, one of the highest totals in the state. We also have a STEM and Honors STEM achievement that is given to those students who go above and beyond in all the stem based classes they take.</h5>

Our school offers a wide variety of science courses, including eight different biology based courses (including a classes based on biotechnology), four chemistry classes, and four physics classes. We also offer unique and interesting Science electives, such as astronomy, zoology, environmental science (and AP environmental science!) and psychology. Our students are receiving a premium-grade scientific education, and many of our graduates have gone on to CU, CSU, the Colorado School of Mines, and many out-of-state colleges to study science and go into scientific fields.</h5>

Meanwhile the engineering classes offered at our school are widely varied and high-quality. We offer such courses as game design, web design, SolidWorks, and even AP Computer Science. There are also four different levels of the Engineering course and three of Technology course, giving our program unprecedented depth. Engineering and technology are stressed at our school, even to the point that many students plan on going into these types of careers when they graduate, and that's part of the reason that our TSA chapter has so many members.</h5>

Take AP Stat and stay back in Calculus AB. Want to learn more about algebra without having to take Algebra II again? Just go into ACC College Algebra or College Trig to brush up on those skills.

          <h5>Our TSA chapter is the largest and one of the most successful in all of the state many years running for a reason. Why, because we have a dedicated officer team and one of the most welcoming environments out there.</h5>
          <br>
          <h5>Our hand picked team of officers is composed entirely of TSA veterans who have all tried out many of the events themselves. They gather two to three times a week with the primary intention of helping us get where we need to be. This dream team is then topped out by the greatest teacher duo out there. They are always around to help students and TSA members with whatever they need. They even have paid out of pocket a few times to benefit our entire TSA chapter or school.</h5>
          <br>
          <h5>The Technology Student Association offers a wide variety of different events to compete in so there is just about always something for everyone whether you want to specify you events to a few topics or if you would like to do a wide variety of different things to learn what you are interested in. Ever confused about what to do or need some help? TSA is there and most likely someone would have been through the problem that you are experiencing. Our TSA chapter is like a second home to many people involved in the club, including myself.</h5>
