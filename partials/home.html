                <h1>WHAT IS AUGMENTED REALITY?</h1>
                <p> Augmented reality is any technology that superimposes a computer-generated image onto a user's view of the real world. It's a broad definition, encompassing many different types of interactions, from military tactical viewports and location-specific marketing to Snapchat and Pokémon Go. AR tech is used for a variety of different purposes, and has been growing more popular in recent years with the advent of better image processing and object recognition tech.</p>

                <h1>WHAT IS IT USED FOR?</h1>
                <p>Augmented reality has the potential to provide a variety of far-reaching benefits. It isn't just one technology, but a class of technologies that can either stand alone or enhance existing technology, and this means there are a multitude of possible uses.</p>
                  <img class='header' src='imgs/headers/awareness.png'>
                  <p>The first one is awareness. Today we are stuck looking down at our phones and gadgets, but augmented reality technologies would allow us to remain looking at the environment instead of a device. This can be especially helpful in situations that are dangerous or where the user needs data quickly and efficiently. It can also be used in the medical field, because doctors can remain looking at a patient while still seeing critical information about the patient. </p>
                  <img class='header' src='imgs/headers/handsfree.png'>
                  <p>The second benefit is the hands-free capability. In jobs that require both hands, such as heavy labor, the ability to not have to set down items just to use a piece of technology for the job can increase efficiency. It can also greatly improve the workflows of information workers, office workers, and others who use their minds to make money - they can perform tasks much more quickly if they don't have to deal with the real world as much. It can also be useful in everyday life - it makes things much more convenient for many. If you're carrying two cups of coffee and a burrito for lunch, for example, it's much nicer to be able to use your devices hands-free. </p>
                  <img class='header' src='imgs/headers/safety.png'>
                  <p>The third benefit of augmented reality is safety. With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and video feeds, a user may be able to see a problem beneath the surface or out of their field of view. This can come in handy in jobs that are especially dangerous. The technology can also be applied to fields, such as firefighting, to allow firefighters to see an aerial view of the structure and identify key locations that may be critical without having to set down equipment and use a handheld tablet. With the help of augmented reality, they would be able to see dangers before they become a problem. Augmented reality provides data quickly and in a form that is easily accessed, while still allowing the user to continue completing a task. Augmented reality also allows for visualization of actions, which can help users see possible consequences or other problems before committing to the task, creating a safe space for simulated trial and error. The ability for augmented reality to adapt and assist the user with changing environments is its biggest benefit. Augmented reality is able to be used in most situations and by most people, which allows for wide adoption to make people more efficient and safer and to improve people’s lives. </p>
