                <h1>WHAT IS AUGMENTED REALITY?</h1>
                <p> Augmented reality is any technology that superimposes a computer-generated image onto a user's view of the real world. It's a broad definition, encompassing many different types of interactions, from military tactical viewports and location-specific marketing to Snapchat and Pokémon Go. AR tech is used for a variety of different purposes, and has been growing more popular in recent years with the advent of better image processing and object recognition tech.</p>

                <h1>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h1>
                <p> Augmented reality takes real-time footage from a camera and turns the environment into a digital “playground,” so to speak. When the headset takes in the video, a complex program scans the environment to place digital objects on your device (be it a phone, a VR headset or a fighter jet windshield) according to the location. It can tell where a wall is, or that couch that you’re looking at, or maybe the kitchen table you’re currently eating at, and overlays it with perspective-respecting digital objects.</p>

                <h1>WHAT IS IT USED FOR?</h1>
                <p>Augmented reality has the potential to provide a variety of far-reaching benefits. It isn't just one technology, but a class of technologies that can either stand alone or enhance existing technology, and this means there are a multitude of possible uses.</p>
                  <img class='header' src='/imgs/headers/awareness.png'>
                  <p>Augmented reality can have a very positive effect on our awareness. The benefits of AR devices are very simple in this regard; they essentially just provide extra information to the user that may not be immediately apparent. This has a great variety of potential applications:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li>
                      <hr>
                      <h3>MILITARY</h3>
                      <p>The military applications of this are quite apparent. Forces in the field will be able to see ongoing action and tactical realities through AR technology, allowing for greater flexibility and effectiveness, as well as a more distributed information hierarchy. Allowing lower-level combatants to receive information in real time will help maintain and enhance their effectiveness and fighting ability. In fact, as one <a href="http://www.popsci.com/experimental-ar-glasses-offer-marines-hands-free-intel"> Popular Science article</a> found, the U.S. Marine Corps has already begun production of a hands-free headgear device for transmitting information to units in the field.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <hr>
                      <h3>MEDICINE</h3>
                      <p>AR tech can also be widely used in medicine, as doctors will be able to see their patients' conditions, pathology and any other relevant information with the touch of a button. It will be especially helpful during surgeries, where information is overlaid on a doctor's view for enhanced accuracy, sensitivity and flexibility, but has many uses for routine medical work as well. Wouldn't you agree it's useful if a doctors is able to overlay his view of a patient's condition (such as, say, a cyst) with other examples of that condition to determine what they're dealing with?
                  </ul>
                  <img class='header' src='/imgs/headers/handsfree.png'>
                  <p>The second benefit is the hands-free capability. In jobs that require both hands, such as heavy labor, the ability to not have to set down items just to use a piece of technology for the job can increase efficiency. It can also greatly improve the workflows of information workers, office workers, and others who use their minds to make money - they can perform tasks much more quickly if they don't have to deal with the real world as much. It can also be useful in everyday life - it makes things much more convenient for many. If you're carrying two cups of coffee and a burrito for lunch, for example, it's much nicer to be able to use your devices hands-free. </p>
                  <img class='header' src='/imgs/headers/safety.png'>
                  <p>The third benefit of augmented reality is safety. With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and video feeds, a user may be able to see a problem beneath the surface or out of their field of view. This can come in handy in jobs that are especially dangerous. The technology can also be applied to fields, such as firefighting, to allow firefighters to see an aerial view of the structure and identify key locations that may be critical without having to set down equipment and use a handheld tablet. With the help of augmented reality, they would be able to see dangers before they become a problem. Augmented reality provides data quickly and in a form that is easily accessed, while still allowing the user to continue completing a task. Augmented reality also allows for visualization of actions, which can help users see possible consequences or other problems before committing to the task, creating a safe space for simulated trial and error. The ability for augmented reality to adapt and assist the user with changing environments is its biggest benefit. Augmented reality is able to be used in most situations and by most people, which allows for wide adoption to make people more efficient and safer and to improve people’s lives. </p>
